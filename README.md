pippo
=====

A pretty interesting pre-processor that uses OCaml.

The actual documentation is, of course, pre-processed using Pippo. It can be
found as `tutorial.pp.html` in the repository. You can read it online
[here](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/protz/pippo/blob/master/tutorial.pp.html).
